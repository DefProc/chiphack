        <h1>An Introduction to FPGA Programming</h1>

<p>Chip Hack is a two day workshop that provides an introduction to programming field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), which is aimed at complete beginners with no prior experience of hardware description languages (HDL) and FPGA workflows.<p>

<p>All the original materials used in the workshop will be made available under a Creative Commons licence and published to GitHub.</a>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p><em>Note that timings are approximate and details subject to change!</em></p>

<h3>Saturday</h3>

<p>Day one will commence with an FPGA primer and introduction to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" title="Wikipedia: Verilog">Verilog</a> HDL. Following which participants will learn by example through a series of increasingly complex hands-on projects, starting with a simple LED-based counter which can be incremented and decremented using push buttons.<p>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<p>The morning of day two will be spent implementing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter" title="Wikipedia:UART">UART</a> transmitter, and for the more ambitious a UART receiver also if time permits.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there will be an introduction to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRISC" title="Wikipedia: OpenRISC">OpenRISC</a> system-on-chip (ORSoC), and a practical exercise in which participants will program their boards with an ORSoC configuration and run bare metal code on the processor!</p>

<p>The event will close with an introduction to the use of Verilog in creating software models of processor designs that are capable of running programs and having a debugger attached to them.</p>

<h2>Suitability</h2>

<p>While no experience of HDLs and FPGA programming is required it is expected that participants will at least have some programming experience and an understanding of basic digital electronics.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the event</h2>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>The workshop will be based around the <a href="http://www.altera.co.uk/education/univ/materials/boards/de0-nano/unv-de0-nano-board.html" title=Altera: DE0-Nano">DE0-Nano</a>, a highly capable but affordable FPGA development board that features a device with 22,320 logic elements, along with buttons, switches, LEDs, ADC, accelerometer and I/O pins.</p>

<p>It is suggested that participants purchase their own DE0-Nano boards, but a limited number of them will be made available for those without their own hardware to use. However, should the majority of people not bring their own hardware some may have to work in small groups.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.altera.com/download/software/quartus-ii-we" title="altera.com: Quartus II Web Edition">Quartus II Web Edition</a> software should be installed <em><u>in advance</u></em> of the workshop.</p>

<h2>Lunch</h2>

<p>Lunch will be provided on both days. Please ensure that you make clear any dietary requirements during registration.</p>
