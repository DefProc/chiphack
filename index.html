        <h1>An Introduction to FPGA Programming</h1>

<p>Chip Hack is a two day workshop that provides an introduction to programming field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), and which is aimed at complete beginners with no prior experience of hardware description languages (HDL) and FPGA workflows.<p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>The first day will commence with an FPGA primer and introduction to the Verilog hardware description language. Following which participants will learn by example through a series of increasingly complex hands-on projects, starting with a simple LED-based counter which can be incremented and decremented using push buttons.<p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>The morning of the second day will be spent implementing a UART transmitter, and for the more ambitious a UART receiver also if time permits. In the afternoon there will be an introduction to the OpenRISC system-on-chip (ORSoC), and a practical exercise in which participants will program their boards with an ORSoC configuration and run bare metal code on the processor!</p>

<p>The event will close with an introduction to the use of Verilog in creating software models of processor designs that are capable of running programs and having a debugger attached to them.</p>
