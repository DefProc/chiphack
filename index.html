        <h1>An Introduction to FPGA Programming</h1>

<p>Chip Hack is a two day workshop that provides an introduction to programming field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), which is aimed at complete beginners with no prior experience of hardware description languages (HDL) and FPGA workflows.<p>

<p>All original materials used in the workshop will be made available under open licences and published to GitHub.</p>

<p>Free <a href="#freefpga">FPGA development systems will be given to the first five teachers</a> that register upon their completing the workshop.</p>

<p>Chip Hack is a <a href="#hfday">Hardware Freedom Day</a> event.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p><em>Note that timings are approximate and details subject to change!</em></p>

<h3>Saturday (10:00-17:00)</h3>

<p>Day one will commence with an FPGA primer and introduction to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" title="Wikipedia: Verilog">Verilog</a> HDL. Following which participants will learn by example through a series of increasingly complex hands-on projects, starting with a simple LED-based counter which can be incremented and decremented using push buttons.<p>

<h3>Sunday (10:00-16:00)</h3>

<p>The morning of day two will be spent implementing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter" title="Wikipedia:UART">UART</a> transmitter, and for the more ambitious a UART receiver also if time permits.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there will be an introduction to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRISC" title="Wikipedia: OpenRISC">OpenRISC</a> Reference Platform system-on-chip (ORPSoC), and a practical exercise in which participants will program their boards with an ORPSoC configuration and run bare metal code on the processor!</p>

<p>The event will close with an introduction to the use of Verilog in creating software models of processor designs that are capable of running programs and having a debugger attached to them.</p>

<h2>Suitability</h2>

<p>While no HDL or FPGA programming experience is required it is expected that participants will at least have some programming experience and an understanding of basic digital electronics.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the event</h2>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>The workshop will be based around the <a href="http://www.altera.co.uk/education/univ/materials/boards/de0-nano/unv-de0-nano-board.html" title=Altera: DE0-Nano">DE0-Nano</a>, a highly capable but affordable FPGA development board that features a device with 22,320 logic elements, along with buttons, switches, LEDs, ADC, accelerometer and I/O pins.</p>

<p>It is suggested that participants purchase their own DE0-Nano from a supplier such as <a href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/programmable-logic-development-kits/7689039/" title="DE0-Nano @ RS">RS Components</a> or <a href="http://uk.farnell.com/terasic-technologies/p0082/cyclone-iv-fpga-deonano-dev-board/dp/2076463" title="DE0-Nano @ Farnell">Farnell</a>. A limited number of boards will be made available for those without their own, however, should the majority not bring hardware some may have to work in small groups.</p>

<p>A laptop computer with a USB port will be required.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.altera.com/download/software/quartus-ii-we" title="altera.com: Quartus II Web Edition">Quartus II Web Edition</a> software should be installed <em><u>in advance</u></em>.</p>

<h2>Lunch</h2>

<p>Lunch will be provided on both days. Please ensure that you make clear any dietary requirements during registration.</p>

<h2>Who</h2>

<p>Chip Hack is sponsored by Embecosm and brought to you by a team of experienced open source software and hardware hackers.</p>

<h3>Julius Baxter (OpenRISC)</h3>

<p><a href="http://juliusbaxter.net/" title="Julius Baxter - personal website">Julius Baxter</a> has been involved with the OpenRISC project for 5 years, and during that time he's worked on everything from processor Verilog RTL to the Linux kernel port. Julius maintains a role as an active developer and maintainer on the OpenRISC project, largely dealing with RTL, toolchain and architecture work.</p>

<h3>Dr Jeremy Bennett (Embecosm)</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.embecosm.com/about/" title="Embecosm - About">Dr Jeremy Bennett</a> is the founder of Embecosm, and an expert on hardware modelling and embedded software development.
