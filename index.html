        <h1>An Introduction to FPGA Programming</h1>

<p>Chip Hack is a two day workshop that provides an introduction to programming field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), and which is aimed at complete beginners with no prior experience of hardware description languages (HDL) and FPGA workflows.<p>

<p>The first day will commence with an FPGA primer and introduction to the Verilog hardware description language. Following which participants will learn by example through a series of increasingly complex hands-on projects, starting with a simple LED-based counter which can be incremented and decremented using push buttons.<p>

<p>The morning of the second day will be spent implementing a UART transmitter, and for the more ambitious a UART receiver also if time permits. In the afternoon there will be an introduction to the OpenRISC system-on-chip (ORSoC), and a practical exercise in which participants will program their boards with an ORSoC configuration and run bare metal code on the processor!</p>

<p>The event will close with an introduction to the use of Verilog in creating software models of processor designs that are capable of running programs and having a debugger attached to them.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
